	<h3 >Project Summary</h3>
	</div>

	<div ><p>This project fits the design brief because it&nbsp;needs a 360 video to be immersive. When grabbing the tools for the tree, you have to look down. When you want to see the animals around you (bird flying over you or horse standing behind you), you have to turn back or look up to physically see them. In most of the scenes, you have to look around to appreciate the full magnitude of the scene. Without the 360 video these experiences would definitely not be as immersive.<br /><br />

	<h3 >The Design Challenge</h3>
	</div>

	<div><p>
	For this project we were challenged to make an environment or experience hygge, with using the Kinect 2.0.
	<br/><br/>
	Based on my preliminary research, hygge is a Danish word used "when acknowledging a feeling or moment, whether alone or with friends, at home or out, ordinary or extraordinary as cosy, charming or special." Further digging of the term hygge, I think is best explained through the view of a Danish person (p.68, Bean), Per, where he he mentions that its not about the space or materials in a space that is hygge; rather, it is the activities associated in that space that make it hygge. For example, a room by itself, with candles and cozy blankets is no doubt comfortable, but is it hygge? Gathering around your friends and playing music together makes it hygge.  In particular, Bean's observation from Per's view of hygge: " The kitchen is hygge only when a couple friends chat in it; the table needs people to “have a nice meal,” the window ledge needs coffee or beer and cigarettes and friends" (p.69, Bean)
	<br/><br/>
	From this I gathered that hygge is an shared experience between you and people you are comfortable with. It is noted in Bean's paper that it is quite common to see the experience of hygge described as process of turning away from the outside world (p.25, Bean). I think hygge is a means to escape reality in some way.

	<h3>The Problem</h3>
	</div>
	<img src = "img/project3/workplace-orig.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%"/>
	<p>When I was on my internship, I noticed people will come in and out of their cubicles, sometimes without saying a word to anyone else. Other times everybody would be so busy that they wouldn't even have time to chat, and we realize we haven't seen each other in months despite the fact that we were on the same floor of the building. Sometimes you would catch people at a bad time. </p>

	<p>
	I started refining my initial ideas, on both jam session and story telling. I felt equally strong about both of these ideas, because I had clear motivations for doing them. However as I was refining my sketches, it became apparent that variations on the jam session idea was the better direction for me. This was simply because it was rather difficult to make the interaction of story telling non-sequential without losing the context of the story. Story telling most often follows a linear plot; if i would have gone the choose-your-own-story route it would mean a significant amount of time to implement the possible scenarios of what could end up happening within the story. If I consider my other variations on this, it would still require a good chunk of implementation time with only a slightly richer interaction based space.

	<p>I revisited a concept that we had discussed in this class (CPSC 581). Usually physical proximity is a way to determine how close you are emotionally to that person, as denoted by the diagram to the right. <br/><br/>
	Through different variations, somewhere along the way I landed in a drum circle and pottery mashup context, where drumming would somehow form the clay on a screen in front of you. I liked the idea of making something together as a group, and the interaction was rich in that it was not sequential. I was also inspired by the idea of emergence, where something amazing can be made out of smaller entities. Some people I talked noted that participating in a drum circle and actively trying to making something together is hygge, and suggested to make it solely sound based as visualization of the clay on a screen takes away from the experience of focusing on each other. Additionally, a Danish source in the iLab disagreed that the concept of drum circles was hygge due to the possibly energetic nature of drumming. I continued to refine my sketches, finding possible ways to make drum circles hygge. </p>

	<p>Along the way, I also tried to make a workplace hygge by incorporating musical instruments instead of drumming sounds. However, this proved to be a challenge since you have to consider what notes work well together, where the notes would be in the space, what would happen when different people would be in the space and how that would affect the overall sound. 
	<br/><br/>
	In my final revision, I decided to reduce my scope and focus on how to make the workplace hygge, and I incorporated different revisions into my final iteration. I moved away from my drum circle idea because I don't have too much knowledge of the space, and because I felt that there was not that much room to explore interactions on how to make the idea more hygge. Making it less energetic would take away from the fun of participating in the drum circle. The corporate workplace is a space I know well, and there's more room to make it hygge since people don't generally associate it as being hygge in the first place.

	<h3>Implementation</h3>
	</div>
	
	

	
	
	
	<p>I used Kinect 2.0 and Unity to implement my idea. Some modifications from my original idea are as follows:</p>
	<ul class="custom-list-u"><li>Instead of going near each other to change the sound, the pair will fist bump each other,&nbsp;to make it more deliberate.</li><li>No distortion because it sounds REALLY BAD. Instead, the sounds will just sound "far away" from each other. This is done by manipulating the low pass cutoff frequency of the sound to be a low number.</li><li>There were some challenges with the Kinect distinguishing different motions (pat air above head, pat air below chest). I changed it so that if your wrist&nbsp;passes a certain point, the system will make the sound.</li><li>There are some limitations with the range of the Kinect. To accommodate, I made the echo quality of the sound (reverb) more abrupt and drastic with the limited range, to make it more obvious.</li></ul> Side note: Debugging the program when you need two people for the interaction is challenging!&nbsp;

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>I thought this prompt was the trickiest out of all the projects. It was nice to have those constraints but at the same time it was challenging as well. In this project I learned the value of feedback, I kept discussing my ideas with my friends, family, co-workers, and instructors, and it was through their opinions about hygge and the interactions I had in my project that I started to form what eventually will be the workplace rhythm project. That back and forth between differing opinions is so important because it allows for diversity of ideas, which in turn allows for interesting refinements.</p>
