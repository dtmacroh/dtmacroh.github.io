        <h3>The Design Challenge</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          For this project we were challenged to make an environment or experience hygge, with using the Kinect 2.0.
          <br/>
          <br/> Based on my preliminary research, hygge is a Danish word used "when acknowledging a feeling or moment, whether
          alone or with friends, at home or out, ordinary or extraordinary as cosy, charming or special." Further digging
          of the term hygge, I think is best explained through the view of a Danish person (p.68, Bean), Per, where he he
          mentions that its not about the space or materials in a space that is hygge; rather, it is the activities associated
          in that space that make it hygge. For example, a room by itself, with candles and cozy blankets is no doubt comfortable,
          but is it hygge? Gathering around your friends and playing music together makes it hygge. In particular, Bean's
          observation from Per's view of hygge: " The kitchen is hygge only when a couple friends chat in it; the table needs
          people to “have a nice meal,” the window ledge needs coffee or beer and cigarettes and friends" (p.69, Bean)
          <br/>
          <br/> From this I gathered that hygge is an shared experience between you and people you are comfortable with. It is
          noted in Bean's paper that it is quite common to see the experience of hygge described as process of turning away
          from the outside world (p.25, Bean). I think hygge is a means to escape reality in some way.

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
      </div>
      <div style="margin-bottom:20px">
        <img src="img/project3/workplace-orig.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" />
        <div style="text-align:center">
          <small>A typical corporate work space</small>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>When I was on my internship, I noticed people will come in and out of their cubicles, sometimes without saying a word
        to anyone else. Other times everybody would be so busy that they wouldn't even have time to chat, and we realize
        we haven't seen each other in months despite the fact that we were on the same floor of the building. Sometimes you
        would catch people at a bad time. </p>

      <h3>The Design Process</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8 col-lg-8">
          <div class="portfolio-item">
            <div class="hover-bg" style="height:300px">
              <p>For this prompt, initial brainstorming sessions involved thinking about hygge-like contexts. I thought about
                birthday parties, I read that everytime there was a special event, the Danish would place a Danish flag on
                that particular date in their calendar.
                <br/>
                <br/> ​I felt like story telling was hygge because it almost seems family-centric; there's something about sharing
                a story with a group of people, creating that shared experience between the story-teller and the audience.
                It's a way to show values, morals and beliefs without explicitly telling people, and a powerful reinforcer
                of community. The Jam Session idea was inspired by Per, in Bean's paper, where he mentions that he identifies
                hygge as playing music together with his friends. Being a hobbyist of music myself (guitar and piano), I
                felt strongly about this idea. I also thought about other environments where hygge could be a challenge,
                such as a retail store or a workout session.</p>

        </div>

        <p>
          I started refining my initial ideas, on both jam session and story telling. I felt equally strong about both of these ideas,
          because I had clear motivations for doing them. However as I was refining my sketches, it became apparent that
          variations on the jam session idea was the better direction for me. This was simply because it was rather difficult
          to make the interaction of story telling non-sequential without losing the context of the story. Story telling
          most often follows a linear plot; if i would have gone the choose-your-own-story route it would mean a significant
          amount of time to implement the possible scenarios of what could end up happening within the story. If I consider
          my other variations on this, it would still require a good chunk of implementation time with only a slightly richer
          interaction based space.

        <p>I revisited a concept that we had discussed in this class (CPSC 581). Usually physical proximity is a way to determine
          how close you are emotionally to that person, as denoted by the diagram to the right.
          <br/>
          <br/> Through different variations, somewhere along the way I landed in a drum circle and pottery mashup context, where
          drumming would somehow form the clay on a screen in front of you. I liked the idea of making something together
          as a group, and the interaction was rich in that it was not sequential. I was also inspired by the idea of emergence,
          where something amazing can be made out of smaller entities. Some people I talked noted that participating in a
          drum circle and actively trying to making something together is hygge, and suggested to make it solely sound based
          as visualization of the clay on a screen takes away from the experience of focusing on each other. Additionally,
          a Danish source in the iLab disagreed that the concept of drum circles was hygge due to the possibly energetic
          nature of drumming. I continued to refine my sketches, finding possible ways to make drum circles hygge. </p>

        <p>Along the way, I also tried to make a workplace hygge by incorporating musical instruments instead of drumming sounds.
          However, this proved to be a challenge since you have to consider what notes work well together, where the notes
          would be in the space, what would happen when different people would be in the space and how that would affect
          the overall sound.
          <br/>
          <br/> In my final revision, I decided to reduce my scope and focus on how to make the workplace hygge, and I incorporated
          different revisions into my final iteration. I moved away from my drum circle idea because I don't have too much
          knowledge of the space, and because I felt that there was not that much room to explore interactions on how to
          make the idea more hygge. Making it less energetic would take away from the fun of participating in the drum circle.
          The corporate workplace is a space I know well, and there's more room to make it hygge since people don't generally
          associate it as being hygge in the first place.

          <h3>Implementation</h3>
        </div>

        <p>I used Kinect 2.0 and Unity to implement my idea. Some modifications from my original idea are as follows:</p>
        <ul class="custom-list-u">
          <li>Instead of going near each other to change the sound, the pair will fist bump each other,&nbsp;to make it more
            deliberate.</li>
          <li>No distortion because it sounds REALLY BAD. Instead, the sounds will just sound "far away" from each other. This
            is done by manipulating the low pass cutoff frequency of the sound to be a low number.</li>
          <li>There were some challenges with the Kinect distinguishing different motions (pat air above head, pat air below
            chest). I changed it so that if your wrist&nbsp;passes a certain point, the system will make the sound.</li>
          <li>There are some limitations with the range of the Kinect. To accommodate, I made the echo quality of the sound (reverb)
            more abrupt and drastic with the limited range, to make it more obvious.</li>
        </ul> Side note: Debugging the program when you need two people for the interaction is challenging!&nbsp;

        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>I thought this prompt was the trickiest out of all the projects. It was nice to have those constraints but at the
          same time it was challenging as well. In this project I learned the value of feedback, I kept discussing my ideas
          with my friends, family, co-workers, and instructors, and it was through their opinions about hygge and the interactions
          I had in my project that I started to form what eventually will be the workplace rhythm project. That back and
          forth between differing opinions is so important because it allows for diversity of ideas, which in turn allows
          for interesting refinements.</p>
