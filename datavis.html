    <p>This project is meant to vizualize crime in Calgary, and other municipalities within Alberta, Canada. Tools used were
      Excel, Tableau, and Jupyter Anaconda (Python).</p>

        <h3 >Analysis Questions</h3>
    </div>
  <div class="center">
  <p> I chose to do this project with the initial intent to see if Forest Lawn, a community in Calgary that I live in, is safe. 
    Since then, I have refocused my intentions to have a more exploratory approach of the data set. Here are the
    revised questions I am most interested in answering and analyzing:</p>
    <ol class="custom-list-o">
    <li>Are older residential communities more prone to crime in Calgary
      (when it was built, sectors in the city)? Does it differ depending on the type of crime?</li>
    <li>What crime is the most prevalent in each city? Are there any differences in crime between municipalities?</li>
    <li>What is the ratio of adult vs youth charged with committing crimes, on average? 
      Does it change drastically depending on the crime? </li>
    <li>What are the top 2 crimes in Alberta, on a province-wide level (includes Alberta and all its cities within, such as Calgary,
      Chestermere, Edmonton and Medicine Hat) that are strongly correlated with one another, by year from 1998 to 2016? 
      We will hone in on correlations with records that have STAs in (Actual Incidents, Total Persons Charged, 
      Total Adult Charged, Total Youth Charged).</li>
    <li>Is there a month or year that crime rises in Calgary? 
      (e.g. before Christmas, after New Yearâ€™s where debt is high, summer where the weather is good, recessions)</li>
    <li>Imagine that in 2008, you lived in Medicine Hat and got job offers in both Calgary and Edmonton. You are a single parent and 
      have young two children living with you. As of 2008, looking at average rate of all crimes of abduction,  corrupting morals of a child,
      luring a child via computer, Obtains or communicates with a person under age 18 for purpose of sex, and hostage taking, which location has the lowest
      average counts of all crimes out of the three (Calgary, Edmonton, Medicine Hat)? 

       </li>        
    </ol>
    <div class="center">
        <h3 >Project 1.1 Recap and Changes</h3>
    </div>
    <p>The only questions that changed from Project 1.1 were questions [4] and [6], which were originally:</p>
       <ol>
         <li>[4] What are the top 2 crimes that are strongly correlated with one another? 
           Which crimes can predict a violent crime such as first-degree murder?</li>
         <li>[6] Is Calgary becoming a more dangerous city? Based on the answers to the 
         questions above, and based on the crime statistics alone, would you decide to live in Calgary and if so where? </li></ol>
    <p>I changed question [4] because it needed more detail about the level 
      of analysis. It was unclear whether the correlations were for the city level, 
      neighborhood level, or if it was by year or month. I since have made it clearer by specifying that it was by municipality level
    with </p>
     <p>I changed question [6] because using the term "you" is very subjective. 
       The question doesn't have a clear sense of who we're talking about and what their tolerances are, 
       it isn't clear how a question like this can be answered.</p>

<div id="q1">
    <div class="center">
        <h3 >Question 1</h3>
    </div>
    <b><i>"Are older residential communities more prone to crime in Calgary (when it was built, sectors in the city)?"</i></b>
    <div class="center">
        <h4 >Analysis Process and Interpretation</h4>
    </div>
    <p>I started off by filtering out the communities that were not residential. In the Calgary shape file data set, values I 
      included from the column COMM STRUC are 1950s, 1960s/1970s, 1980s/1990s, 2000s, and Building Out. Values that I excluded Centre City, Inner City, Employment,
      Other, Parks and Undeveloped, because they do not inform of what time period communities were built. In the column Class, values I 
      included are Residential and Residential Sub, while I excluded Industrial and Major Park. I made a quick graph to illustrate the average
    yearly crime over the time period that these communities were built, each color representing a sector (North, South, Southeast, etc.).
    The yearly crime is calculated by the aggregating the sum of the crime counts (Value column) from 2012 to 2017 divided by the number of 
    distinct Years (around 6).</p>
<p>
    Some of the limitations here is that not all communities have data from 2012 (some started in 2013), so the averages for such communities
    will be slightly smaller. Census data for each of the communities will also be helpful to normalize the data more but due to time contraints I was not able to 
    integrate this. As such, the averages for sections with outliers (e.g. Forest Lawn built in the 1950s) will pull up the average a lot, since
    it has a much higher value than all the other communities in the same time period.

    </p>

            <div class="hover-text">
              <small>Yearly Average Crime Count by Time Period Built - The labels are visible on the maximum and minimum values
                by time period. The size of the data point is attributed to how large the yearly average crime count is for that 
                specific community.
              </small>
              <div class="clearfix"></div>

      </div>
    
      <p>It seems that the community with the most crime in each time period that the communities were built (e.g. 1950s, 1960s/1970s, 
        1980s/1990s, 2000s, and Building Out) does seems to follow a downward trend of crime, the newer the community is.  However
        when we look at the average number of crimes per time period, we see that there is a slight downward trend between 1960s and 
        onwards, but communities in the 1950s actually have a lower average crime count than the 1960s/1970s.   </p>
        <p>Breaking it off and looking at it by sector, and by time period:</p>
