        <h3 >Analysis Questions</h3>
    </div>
  <div class="center">
  <p> I chose to do this project with the initial intent to see if Forest Lawn, a community in Calgary that I live in, is safe. 
    Since then, I have refocused my intentions to have a more exploratory approach of the data set. Here are the
    revised questions I am most interested in answering and analyzing:</p>
    <ol class="custom-list-o">
    <li>Are older residential communities more prone to crime in Calgary
      (when it was built, sectors in the city)? Does it differ depending on the type of crime?</li>
    <li>What crime is the most prevalent in each city? Are there any differences in crime between municipalities?</li>
    <li>What is the ratio of adult vs youth charged with committing crimes, on average? 
      Does it change drastically depending on the crime? </li>
    <li>What are the top 2 crimes in Alberta, on a province-wide level (includes Alberta and all its cities within, such as Calgary,
      Chestermere, Edmonton and Medicine Hat) that are strongly correlated with one another, by year from 1998 to 2016? 
      We will hone in on correlations with records that have STAs in (Actual Incidents, Total Persons Charged, 
      Total Adult Charged, Total Youth Charged).</li>
    <li>Is there a month or year that crime rises in Calgary? 
      (e.g. before Christmas, after New Year’s where debt is high, summer where the weather is good, recessions)</li>
    <li>Imagine that in 2010, you live in Medicine Hat and you want to move to Calgary or Edmonton, and you have dependants living with you. 
      As of 2010, looking at total rate of all crimes against children, which location has the lowest
     total crime rate out of the three (Calgary, Edmonton, Medicine Hat)? 

       </li>        
    </ol>
    <div class="center">
        <h3 >Project 1.1 Recap and Changes</h3>
    </div>
    <p>The only questions that changed from Project 1.1 were questions [4] and [6], which were originally:</p>
       <ol>
         <li>[4] What are the top 2 crimes that are strongly correlated with one another? 
           Which crimes can predict a violent crime such as first-degree murder?</li>
         <li>[6] Is Calgary becoming a more dangerous city? Based on the answers to the 
         questions above, and based on the crime statistics alone, would you decide to live in Calgary and if so where? </li></ol>
    <p>I changed question [4] because it needed more detail about the level 
      of analysis. It was unclear whether the correlations were for the city level, 
      neighborhood level, or if it was by year or month. I since have made it clearer by specifying that it was by municipality level
    with </p>
     <p>I changed question [6] because using the term "you" is very subjective. 
       The question doesn't have a clear sense of who we're talking about and what their tolerances are, 
       it isn't clear how a question like this can be answered.</p>

    <div class="center">
        <h3 >Question 1</h3>
    </div>
    <b><i>"Are older residential communities more prone to crime in Calgary (when it was built, sectors in the city)?"</i></b>
    <div class="center">
        <h4>Analysis Process and Interpretation</h4>
    </div>
    <p>I started off by filtering out the communities that were not residential. In the Calgary shape file data set, values I 
      included from the column COMM STRUC are 1950s, 1960s/1970s, 1980s/1990s, 2000s, and Building Out. Values that I excluded Centre City, Inner City, Employment,
      Other, Parks and Undeveloped, because they do not inform of what time period communities were built. In the column Class, values I 
      included are Residential and Residential Sub, while I excluded Industrial and Major Park. I made a quick graph to illustrate the average
    yearly crime over the time period that these communities were built, each color representing a sector (North, South, Southeast, etc.).
    The yearly crime is calculated by the aggregating the sum of the crime counts (Value column) from 2012 to 2017 divided by the number of 
    distinct Years (around 6).</p>
<p>
    Some of the limitations here is that not all communities have data from 2012 (some started in 2013), so the averages for such communities
    will be slightly smaller. Census data for each of the communities will also be helpful to normalize the data more but due to time contraints I was not able to 
    integrate this. As such, the averages for sections with outliers (e.g. Forest Lawn built in the 1950s) will pull up the average a lot, since
    it has a much higher value than all the other communities in the same time period.

    </p>

              <small>Yearly Average Crime Count by Time Period Built - The labels are visible on the maximum and minimum values
                by time period. The size of the data point is attributed to how large the yearly average crime count is for that 
                specific community.

      </div>
    
      <p>It seems that the community with the most crime in each time period that the communities were built (e.g. 1950s, 1960s/1970s, 
        1980s/1990s, 2000s, and Building Out) does seems to follow a downward trend of crime, the newer the community is.  However
        when we look at the average number of crimes per time period, we see that there is a slight downward trend between 1960s and 
        onwards, but communities in the 1950s actually have a lower average crime count than the 1960s/1970s. Looking at the averages,
      I wondered if the different number of communities was affecting the averages.  </p>
        <p>Breaking it off and looking at it by sector, and by time period:</p>

            <p>It seems like by sector, the northeast has the highest average yearly crime rate, with the south being a 
              close second. When we split the data up by time period communities were built, and have the average yearly crime
              for each sector on a separate y-axis, it seems like in the 1960s/1970s there were 45 communities built, while
              in the 1950s there were 44. Looking at the graph below it seems like the the older communities, especially 
              ones built in 1960s/1970s, had a higher average yearly crime count. It also looks like sectors like the northeast and
              south had the most overall yearly crime.

        Does it change noticeably depending on the crime? "</i></b>
   
    <div class="center">
        <h4>Analysis Process and Interpretation</h4>
    </div>
    <p>This can be done by using the augmented “By Crime” data set, with the values "Rate Youth charged per 
      100 000 population" subtracted with "Rate Adult charged per 100 000 population", and setting this 
      as a new calculation field. I filtered in all values with Alberta as the location, and filtered out 
      youth specific crimes like Youth Criminal Justice Act. I computed the yearly average difference in rate
      and placed them in the bar chart. Positive values will denote a blue hue while negative values will have a 
      red hue. Youth in this case will be all persons under 18.
      </p>

       <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
        
          <div class="hover-bg"> <a href="img/datavis/youthToAdultRatio.png" rel="prettyPhoto">

      </div>
      <p>Personally, the results make a lot of sense. Breaking and Entering, Shoplifting and Theft $5,000 or under
        would have more youth commiting these crimes maybe because of peer pressure, or to make themselves seem 
        cooler. Not to mention youth committing these crimes probably are not so smart in the manner of executing
        these crimes, which makes them more likely to get caught. On the other end of the spectrum, more adults get
        caught driving while prohibited or impaired operation of a motor vehicle likely because not as many 
        young people have their driver's license. Adults do more fraud related crimes likely because they know there is much more to gain
        from them, compared to young people's knowledge. Adults generally have more money and assets, and can probably 
        impersonate other adults better than youth can. In gerneral it seems like petty crimes are committed more by young people,
        and crimes that need driver's licenses or a higher level of thinking (fraud) are committed by adults.

      <p>Initially, I had high hopes that the top correlation pair was actually correlated. However when I later plotted the values in a
          correlation chart, I found out only two data points in the chart. Confused, I did some investigation by summing 
          up the total number occurences per crime, per year and extracted the minimum number of occurences for the pair of crimes.These counts
          were extracted by filtering in STAs in (Actual Incidents, 
          Total Persons Charged, Total Adult Charged, Total Youth Charged), while filtering out the rates and the percentage change
        to avoid confusion. What I found was for the top correlated crimes, there were 2 counts of Common Bawdy House and 14 counts of distribution of child 
          pornography. The next 2 had few numbers as well, 4 and 15 respectively. Considering these numbers I cannot assume these crimes
          are actually correlated because the number of occurences are too low.

      <p>It turns out the highest pair of crimes that are most likely correlated is breaking and entering, and theft 5,000 or under.
          Looking at the minimum count for both these crimes, we get 500 counts which I think is a reasonably high amount.

            <pre>The following seasons (in Canada) are made up of the following months:
                    
                Spring is from March to May
                Summer is from June to August
                Fall is from September to November
                Winter is from December to February
        </pre>

    </div>
    </div>

    <p>It looks like over the years crime has had a cyclical pattern, with summer having the most crime each year and winter
        having the least crime. Personally this makes sense because Calgary winters are very cold and you would not want to stay
        out for a long period of time.
