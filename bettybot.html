    <p>In this project, we look at how we can develop a robot whose primary focus is to 
        provide a positive interaction with a senior in addition to providing services that would enable the senior to be independent. 
        To achieve this, we propose using a Pioneer P3-DX and building various functionality to make this robot a companion to seniors 
        in their own homes. We will look not only to achieve a need but research how robotics companies going forward can place more of an 
        emphasis on the interaction of robots with seniors, possibly allowing them to be incorporated into our society and fulfill a very demanding need.

        <h3 >Problem</h3>
    </div>
  <div class="center">
  <p>
        The number of elderly people are rapidly growing as the baby boomer population is maturing. As such, the need for health care providers is increasing, but the resources available are not growing as quickly.
        Falls are one of the main causes of mortality, immobility, and early nursing home placement in the elderly. The combination of high incidence of falls, high susceptibility to injury, and occurrence of clinical diseases can make even a mild fall dangerous for the elderly. Falls often cause healthy independent elderly people to lose mobility and require constant care. Hence, it is very important that elderly people who have fallen receive immediate care so that they can be treated and so have minimal effects on their later quality of life. Thus, getting them immediate help when they are on their own and have fallen, without compromising their privacy and independence, is an important problem for improving the lives of the elderly.

        <h3 >State of the Art</h3>
    </div>
   
<p>While looking into the field of senior care with robots we discovered the following existing robots that offer different types of support to the elderly or infirm. 

    <ul>
        <li> <li>   <a href="https://www.care-o-bot.de/en/care-o-bot-4.html" target="_blank">Care-o-bot 4</a></li>The highlight of this robot is its ability to perform human actions without the uncanny nature many anthropomorphic robots have. It has the ability to walk and navigate through the room, be used as a support for walking, and even does household chores. </li><br/><br/>
        
        <li> <li><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nurse-bot/web/papers/umich/aaai02wkshp.pdf" target="_blank">Pearl</a></li>This robo-nurse may appear uncanny to many, but the critical feature Pearl offers is its ability to assist the elderly in taking medication. It can recognize when a person is taking their medication and when they are not. </li><br/><br/>
       
        <li><li><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rp-vita-robot-on-wheels-lets-docs-treat-patients-remotely/" target="_blank">RP-VITA robot</a></li> This robot allows physicians to remotely communicate in their designated hospitals to diagnose patients and offer medical advice.</li><br/><br/>

        <li><li><a href="http://www.cybedroid.com/" target="_blank">CybeDroid</a></li>This robot is meant to help the handicapped and elderly with social companionship. It can escort people to their room, detect danger, and deliver meals.</li> <br/><br/>
        
        <li><li><a href="http://rtc.nagoya.riken.jp/RI-MAN/index_us.html" target="_blank">Ri-Man</a></li>A personal assistant robot meant to lift and carry people that face mobility issues in their home. Meant to lower client’s dependence on other people.</li>

    </ul>
       <p> These robots all fulfill particular purposes that may be very useful to elderly living in their homes. In particular, we found medication and mobility assistance particularly interesting methods through which to create meaningful interaction, and robots that can help with daily tasks and in improving an elderly person’s social interaction. 
        </p>

<div id="initsolut">
    <div class="center">
        <h3 >Our Initial Solution</h3>
    </div>
   
<p>One of the main objectives of our robot is to assist elderly people when they experience a fall. This will involve providing a level of effective support and a means to escalate the matter further by contacting an emergency contact that has been previously set up by the user. 
        Our ultimate goal is not to simply create a single purpose robot but an entity that that allows elderly people to live on their own and feel safe in case of emergencies. An important note is that while aiming to achieve this, we want to explore on the depth of each deceptively simple human-robot interaction to give the user the best possible experience with our robot -- so they feel safe and independent. 
        With Bettybot, our goal is to help make seniors’ lives better without forcing them to become dependant on a senior home or a personal aid worker. We aim to create a robotic entity that can fulfill specific needs of the elderly, and also one that elderly people can feel comfortable around.  
        Some nice to have (optional) features that the team is hoping to implement includes: </p>
        <ol class="custom-list-o">
         <li>Pill carrying and medication reminder throughout the day (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner). Reminders require acknowledgment from user, else another reminder will happen in another fifteen minutes. </li>
         <li>Ability to set alarms/reminders </li>
         <li>Ability to call others </li>
         <li>Ability to show entertainment on the laptop (pictures, news, music, etc) </li>
         <li>Ability to control smart home devices </li>
        </ol>

        <div class="center">
            <h3 >Strategy</h3>
        </div>
       
    <p>The ARIA SDK is integrated with the Pioneer robot, and runs the robot navigation functionality which is controlled by one of us. A python script then runs that responds to the Google Home, which is set atop the Pioneer, and deals with the voice interaction. A phone accelerometer has been hooked up with IFTTT (If This Then That) in order to notify a Dropbox server that a fall has occurred, which activates that python script. Physical movements that are programmed need to override the user-controlled movements.</p>
